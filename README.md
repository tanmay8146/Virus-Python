# Virus-Python

# Disclaimer
These python scripts are for educational and fun purposes only. I(TanmayXD) am not assosiated with any hacker organizations and just wanted to demonstrate how easy it is to code a ransomeware.
Don't use these scripts for any unethical purpose, unless ofcourse you don't want to end up in jail. The developer is not responsible for any loss of data and the code should be run in an isolated directory.

Have fun.
